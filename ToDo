** Top priority **
projLeader/projName directory structure for all routes has to be REPLACED with projName/ only.

1. projName and majorHash in an object to be returned back to blockchain.

2. (Inform Gopi) authorname = participantCard's Identifier (i.e. get name) and authoremail => Both should be kept in world state.

3. (Need to confirm) Add a addRemote, deleteRemote, listRemotes API 

4. Try JSON.stringify for a string which has a code snippet. 

5. git init - direct bare. 
    add file:
        1. IPFS fetch bare repo -> git clone first (to get local repo on server)
        ( What to check for when modifying initial checks incase of an operation like addFile?:
            1. Check whether the bare repo exists or not.
                - if not, fetch it from IPFS. 
                - then clone the repo (can also overwrite.. its ok)
            2. check if normal repo exists or not.
                - if not, clone from the bare repo (write this clone seperate as a utility function - for reusability)
        )
        2. Perform action (addFile route logic)
        3. (auto) Commit changes to local server repo
        4. Use cloneBare to overwrite bare repo on server 
        5. Add the bare repo to IPFS.


6. diff between two commit hashes (previous to the current hash and current hash) route
    - new route (diffFiles.js) 

7. read file and send buffer (seperate route) (done)

8. Features remaining:
    - Branch Commit history (git log) (use isomorphic's git.log) (save or pass the parent commit hash of current hash)
    - File Commit history (git log --oneline -p file_name) (use exec) (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1786027/how-to-view-file-history-in-git)
    - diffFiles (Relevant ToDo - 6) (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/424071/how-to-list-all-the-files-in-a-commit - for showing the list of files in a commit) 
    - readForBuffer (Just a single fs.readFile) *COMPLETE THIS FIRST AND BE DONE WITH THIS*
    - downloadRepo (check the comment written in route) **LOW PRIORITY**
    - pushToBare (a route that auth layer can call for enabling push to the bare repo)
