1. projName and majorHash in an object to be returned back to blockchain.
Reminder: projLeader, projName, branchName, majorHash are required by IPFS and git APIs.

2. (Inform Gopi) authorname = participantCard's Identifier (i.e. get name) and authoremail => Both should be kept in world state.

3. Add a addRemote, deleteRemote, listRemotes API

projLeader/projName directory structure REPLACED with projName/ only.

4. Try JSON.stringify for a string which has a code snippet.

5. git init - direct bare. 
    add file:
        1. IPFS fetch bare repo -> git clone first (to get local repo on server)
        ( What to check for when modifying initial checks incase of an operation like addFile?:
            1. Check whether the bare repo exists or not.
                - if not, fetch it from IPFS. 
                - then clone the repo (can also overwrite.. its ok)
            2. check if normal repo exists or not.
                - if not, clone from the bare repo (write this clone seperate as a utility function - for reusability)
        )
        2. Perform action (addFile route logic)
        3. (auto) Commit changes to local server repo
        4. Push to bare repo on server  (Can make this a utility function as well - for reusability)
        5. Add the bare repo to IPFS.


6. diff between two commit hashes (previous to the current hash and current hash) route
    - new route (diffFiles.js) 

7. read file and send buffer (seperate route)
